# Cards
Android App // Scryfall API

ONLY SOME FEW CARD FORM FUNCTIONALITIES MADE

Testing Scryfall API usage. (https://scryfall.com/docs/api/)

Requests made using Retrofit. (https://square.github.io/retrofit/)

Functionalities
1) Recommended text is automatically populated when typing 3 characters and being idle for 1 second. If you type before the request finishes, the request will be cancelled (redoing it after 1 second of idleness).

2) When clicking the "Select set..." spinner, a request for the card prints will be made using the actual card name. The spinner will be populated with the right card's prints/sets.

3) After selecting a print/set, it's image preview will be loaded.
